# BuildAVirus
Clone of plague inc

Upgrade a sample virus until you either kill off the entire world, or the world builds immunity to you.
Users will be given a couple viruses to choose to play from, based on their choice they will get different upgrade paths.
Killing off more people will award more points. Allowing upgrades to be purchased.

## MVP:
  - [ ] Pause, Play, Quit
  - [ ] Have sample viruses
  - [ ] Be able to spread a virus
  - [ ] Add options to spread a virus
  - [ ] Add options to upgrade a virus
  - [ ] Add options to beat science
  - [ ] Be able to win
  - [ ] Be able to lose

## Technologies:
This Project will be implemented using the following technologies:
  - Javascript for game logic
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Interactive maps for virus control/alerts `https://github.com/markmarkoh/datamaps`
  - Virus genome api to generate information on different viruses `https://www.viprbrc.org/brc/staticContent.spg?decorator=pox&type=ViprInfo&subtype=API`

## Anticipated Technical Problems:
  - Figuring out how to have a interactive map
  - creating markers only in a certain continent.
  - Allowing the user to make a virus stronger
  - Making a virus weaker randomly
  - Balancing virusâ€™



(Possibly not needed)
## Database for:
  - Symptoms 
  - Methods of spreading viruses
  - Abilities
  - Science
  - Research
  - Ports
  - Airports
  
## Wireframes
This App will have a single screen with a map, with modals that will allow users to upgrade their virus. A navbar will be included, with links to my github/linkedin

## Timeline

**Day 1:** Start by getting map setup on page and start building game logic. Find information for viruses to "seed" my app. Figure out if genome api is going to be useful.
 Goals for the day: 
 * Get one virus' build path setup.
 
 **Day 2:** Continue building game logic.
 
 **Day 3:** Build interfaces for upgrading/getting points
 
 **Day 4:** Allow users to start and play a game.
